Las Meninas is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Vel√°zquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. It has become one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting, due to the way its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and the uncertain relationship it creates between the viewer and the figures depicted.
